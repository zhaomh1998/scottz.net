## Research Interest

My research focuses on **Embodied and Embedded AI Systems** that make artificial intelligence accessible, modular, and seamlessly integrated into everyday life. I build complete end-to-end systems spanning three layers: intelligent cores with physical capabilities (agentic AI and autonomous platforms), powerful backends (novel sensing techniques and control algorithms), and accessible frontends (modular hardware platforms, natural language interfaces, and voice-based interactions). These systems enable AI to perceive, understand, and interact with real-world across applications in **smart homes, health monitoring, wearable computing, and autonomous systems**, creating a future where intelligent technology is an active, adaptable participant in our daily lives.
