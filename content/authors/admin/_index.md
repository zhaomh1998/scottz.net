Minghui (Scott) Zhao is a fourth year Ph.D. candidate working at Columbia Intelligent and Connected Systems Lab (ICSL) supervised by Prof. Xiaofan (Fred) Jiang. His research focuses on advancing embodied AI through the development of low-cost, accessible platforms that enable AI systems to perceive and interact with the physical world. By creating affordable and scalable sensing and actuation solutions, his work aims to democratize access to advanced AI technologies across diverse communities, bridging the technological divide between urban and underserved areas. Before his Ph.D., Scott earned his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from UC San Diego and master's degree in Computer Engineering at Columbia University.
