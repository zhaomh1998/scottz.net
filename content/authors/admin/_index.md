Minghui (Scott) Zhao is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University's Intelligent and Connected Systems Lab (ICSL), supervised by Prof. Xiaofan (Fred) Jiang. His research focuses on developing embodied and embedded AI systems that enable intelligent agents to perceive, understand, and act in the physical world. Through hardware-software co-design and physics-informed machine learning, he develops novel sensing techniques, intelligent decision-making frameworks, and accessible hardware platforms that perform robustly in real-world, resource-constrained settings. These systems enable new capabilities in autonomous inspection and indoor logistics, home-based and community health monitoring that support aging and remote care, and intelligent homes and buildings, paving the way for AI that actively participates in and improves our daily lives. Before his Ph.D., Scott earned his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UC San Diego and M.S. in Computer Engineering at Columbia University.
