abstract: Automatic drone landing is an important step for achieving fully autonomous drones. Although there are many works that leverage GPS, video, wireless signals, and active acoustic sensing to perform precise landing, autonomous drone landing remains an unsolved challenge for palm-sized microdrones that may not be able to support the high computational requirements of vision, wireless, or active audio sensing. We propose AIRA, a low-cost infrared light-based platform that targets precise and efficient landing of low-resource microdrones. AIRA consists of an infrared light bulb at the landing station along with an energy efficient hardware photodiode (PD) sensing platform at the bottom of the drone. AIRA costs under 83 USD, while achieving comparable performance to existing vision-based methods at a fraction of the energy cost. AIRA requires only three PDs without any complex pattern recognition models to accurately land the drone, under 10cm of error, from up to 11.1 meters away, compared to camera-based methods that require recognizing complex markers using high resolution images with a range of only up to 1.2 meters from the same height. Moreover, we demonstrate that AIRA can accurately guide drones in low light and partial non line of sight scenarios, which are difficult for traditional vision-based approaches.

summary: A low-cost infrared-based platform for precise microdrone landing, achieving 10cm accuracy from 11.1m range with 9.2x range improvement over vision-based methods.
