abstract: Running with a consistent cadence (number of steps per minute) is important for runners to help reduce risk of injury, improve running form, and enhance overall bio-mechanical efficiency. We introduce CaNRun, a non-contact and acoustic-based system that uses sound captured from a mobile device placed on a treadmill to predict and report running cadence. CaNRun obviates the need for runners to utilize wearable devices or carry a mobile device on their body while running on a treadmill. CaNRun leverages a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract steps observed from the microphone to robustly estimate cadence. Through an 8-person study, we demonstrate that CaNRun achieves cadence detection accuracy without calibration for individual users, which is comparable to the accuracy of the Apple Watch despite being non-contact.

summary: A non-contact acoustic-based system for treadmill cadence estimation using smartphones, achieving accuracy comparable to Apple Watch.
